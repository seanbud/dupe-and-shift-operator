# dupe-and-shift-operator
This project is a Blender 3D operator used for modeling pipes, hoses, and repeating cylindrical meshes.

By creating only a small portion of the desigred mesh, you can use this operator to duplicate it / shift it over many times to easily create interesting and complex structures.

Currently the plugin exists as a seperate script called 'dupe-and-shift-operator.py', and it's setup to be run inside the 'dupe-and-shift-example.blend' file.


## Demonstration of the operator
Below is a demonstration of how the operator works

## Typical use case

Below is an example of how you could use curves to deform the meshes that this operator helps create.
